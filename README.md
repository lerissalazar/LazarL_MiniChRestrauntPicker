Open up the program, run it by pressing f5. Then copy the URL and paste it into postman, add in the Controller name and the Route name ("restpicker/picker/{input}"). 
Enter a category into the input and the computer will output a restraunt suggestion

peer review: Andrew Nilsson - really basic restaurant names. Maybe try and make a random input to output a random restaurant from any category
